Hey Tayyab! 👋

Just wanted to check in on you — how are you feeling right now? How's your health doing these days?

I'm keeping you in my prayers and hoping you recover soon. Take care of yourself! 🤲


## Recovery Actions
1. Check MCP server logs for details
2. Verify MCP server configuration in .env
3. Retry manually or move back to vault/Approved/
